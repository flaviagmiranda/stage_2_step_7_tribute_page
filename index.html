      <h3 class="story-title">Early Years</h3>
  
      <p>Born in Hawaii in 1990, Bethany Hamilton began competitive surfing at age 8, and by age 9 she had earned her first sponsorship. <b>Her life goal was to become a famous professional surfer</b>.
      </p>
      <p>A member of the Hanalei Surf Co. team, the home-schooled Hamilton proved capable of beating more experienced surfers in competition. In May 2003, she won both her age group and the open division of Hawaii's Local Motion/Ezekiel Surf Into Summer event. Shortly afterward, she finished second in the open women's division of the National Scholastic Surfing Association (NSSA) National Championships at San Clemente, California.

      <h3 class="story-title">Shark Attack</h3>
  
      <p>It was the Halloween of 2003 when a life-changing event happened for her. It started out as a normal day for Bethany, who was 13 years old at the time, as she woke up and went surfing as usual. She was increasingly establishing herself as a professional surfer and, as mentioned, her life was all about achieving this result, training every day surfing the Hawaiian waves.
      </p>
      <p>Waves were nothing special that day, but then <b>everything happened in few seconds</b>: Bethany was on the surfboard paddling, and she remembers seeing the clear water around her turn bright red with her blood. <b>She never saw the 14-foot tiger shark closing in on her.</b>
      </p>
      <p id="citation">"I was holding onto my board, with my thumb, because I probably didn't want to get pulled under. It was like pulling me back and forth, not like pulling me underwater. Just like, you know how you eat a piece of steak? It was kind of like that." - Bethany H.
      <p>When Bethany saw her arm had bitten off almost to the shoulder, as told by her friend, Alana Blanchard later, her reaction was totally under control. Nobody of them lost their head, they knew that the first thing to do was to reach the beach quickly.
        After the first aid on the beach, Bethany was rushed to the hospital where she knew from doctors that <b>she lost her left arm.</b>
      </p>
      <p>With that, she realized <b>she might never be able to surf again</b>, so she confessed to her father the possibility of becoming a surf photographer to continue to enjoy surfing. <B>This possibility never came true because just a month after the accident, after the surgery and treatment Bethany gets back to the ocean trying to surfing with an arm.</b> She found the strenght that has always made her think she was born to surf and the deep faith of Bethany has been crucial to accepting the accident as an <b>opportunity.</b></p>
    </div>
    <div class="text container">
      <h3 class="story-title">Back On The Board</h3>
      <p>Unimaginably, Bethany returned back on the board only a month after the attack. With optimism, faith and persistence she started training herself, aiming to enter surf competitions again. <b>On her first rivalry after the accident, she placed 5th on the Open Women division of the contest.</b></p>
  
      <p>Not more than a year later, she took <b>1st place in the Explorer Women's division of the 2005 NSSA Surfing Championships, winning her first national title.</b> With no intentions to stop, the fearless surfer still continues to kill the big waves today.</p>
  
      <p>In 2007, at 17 years old, <b>Hamilton reached her lifelong dream and turned pro.</b> After turning into a professional surfer, she has competed in several World Tour events among many other major significant contests. One of her career highlights was to <B>finish second on the ASP World Junior Championships in 2009</b>.</p>

        <h3 class="story-title">Career</h3>
        <p>As mentioned, coming back after the shark attack, Bethany found success in surfing competition; now she makes her mark as a professional surfer in the free surfing arena (chasing waves, getting photos/videos published, and “Living The Search”). She currently competes in choice World Surf League (WSL) tour events, upon invite, and in other special events. </p>
        <p>In 2016 alone, Bethany’s capacity to inspire reached new heights as <b>she beat a six-time world champion and the top-ranked surfer in the world at a major WSL competition.</b> By overcoming some of the hardest challenges and relentlessly pursuing her passion, <b>she has become one of the leading professional surfers of all time. In 2017, she was inducted into the Surfer’s Hall of Fame.</b></p>
